<ul> Once I graduate from college. I want to pursue a job with cybersecurity. It does not matter where inside the United States but preferably, I would like to work with the Publix Corporation or with my neighbor (who has his own company). The reason why I would like to work with the Publix corporation is because I already have a job there and I would know that it is a good company to achieve great results. Also, it would help me advance in my knowledge of behind the scenes work at the grocery stores. The end goal with cybersecurity is to work with the blue team so that I do not have to do too much coding and I can help the other members of my team succeed with myself included as well.
<br> If this option does not work, then I would like to see how far I can go with Business Analytics and Information Systems since I am getting a degree in it. I know that Publix does have a department for this group so I would like to try that otherwise, I would weigh my options to see what I can do. I would like to eventually have my own company and be able to be successful in the end.
